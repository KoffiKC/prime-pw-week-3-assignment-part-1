      <p>Hey can I still put questions here? thats my only question ;) </br>
      No but really, I was intterested in the syntax used on line 67 of array-practice.js </br>
      specifically '${animalArray}', is this just another way to concatinate varibles? </br>
      Or is it just something for arrays? Now that im thinking about I'll probably ask </br>in class 
      before you read this, I already typed it though so might aswell leave it lol.</p>
